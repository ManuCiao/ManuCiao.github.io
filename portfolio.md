<p class="message">
  I am an newbie excited to learn how to code.. I started my journey at University where I got scared how much I had to learn if I wanted to become
  an amazing developer but then I realised that anyone can actually learn, anyone can self-teaching anything the only important ingredient is to be Resilient,
  never give up even when things gets difficult to understand. So then I decided to start one of those famous bootcamp here in London, I should say
  the Great Makers Academy bootcamp, where the main taught coding languages are Ruby, Javascript and various related framework.
  I had a passion for Django, to be fair I am not sure why I picked this one. I think I liked how it sounds.. :)
  Since that day when I decided to be a web developer I never looked back I am taking now my time to learn as much as I can in order to become part 
  of an amazing IT team where I will contribute to the growth of the company.
